## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is kept up to date automatically by the `post-commit` hook in
`.githooks/post-commit` (activated by `pnpm install` via the `prepare` script,
which sets `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`).

How it works:

- After each commit, the hook prepends `- <commit subject>. (\`<short sha>\`)`to the`## Unreleased` section and amends the change into the same commit.
- The hook stays out of the way when:
  - `CHANGELOG.md` is already part of the commit (you wrote your own entry).
  - The commit is a merge, revert, fixup, squash, or `chore(changelog)` /
    `chore(release)` commit.
  - The commit subject is a bare version number like `0.4.9` or `v1.2.3`.
  - A rebase, cherry-pick, revert, or merge is in progress.
  - The commit's short SHA is already present in `## Unreleased`.

What this means for you:

- Write a clear, single-line commit subject — it becomes the changelog entry.
- If you want a more detailed entry than the subject line, edit `## Unreleased`
  yourself and stage `CHANGELOG.md` as part of the commit. The hook will detect
  it and leave your entry alone.
- Don't add version numbers or dates manually. The release workflow
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) bumps `package.json` and renames
  `## Unreleased` to `## <new version> - <YYYY-MM-DD>` when a maintainer
  triggers a release.
- Don't run version-bump commands locally (`pnpm version`, `npm version`,
  etc.); use the release workflow instead so the changelog and tags stay in sync.

## Linting

After making code changes, always run:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

Fix any reported issues before finishing the task.

## Testing

Always run tests via `pnpm test` — never `vitest` or `pnpm exec vitest run`
directly. The test script rebuilds native modules (`better-sqlite3`) for system
Node, runs vitest, then restores them for Electron. Skipping this leaves the
wrong ABI and breaks `pnpm dev` / `pnpm build`.

Tests are colocated as `src/**/*.test.ts`. See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for
philosophy, coverage goals, and when to add tests.

## Package manager

Use `pnpm` only. Lockfile is `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Do not use npm or yarn.

## Dependencies and scope

- Do not add new dependencies without maintainer approval.
- Avoid large refactors unless explicitly requested.
- New native deps must be added to `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` in
  `package.json`.

## Generated files

Never commit `docs/.vitepress/cache/` (VitePress build cache). Do not hand-edit
generated docs nav — use `pnpm docs:build:nav`.

## Architecture

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for project layout, the IPC contract
(`src/shared/types/` → `src/preload/index.ts` → `src/main/ipc/index.ts`), code
style, and path aliases.

## User interface

Never use native browser dialogs (`alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`) in the renderer.
They block the Electron renderer thread and break visual consistency.

- Use custom modals built on [`Modal`](src/renderer/src/components/Modal/index.tsx) for
  blocking messages and confirmations (`AlertModal`, `ConfirmModal`, or
  feature-specific dialogs like `QuitPrompt`).
- Show errors inline (`text-danger`) when the user is already inside a modal or
  settings form.
- Use `react-hot-toast` only for non-blocking success or info feedback, not for
  errors that require acknowledgment.

Helpers live in [`dialogHelpers.ts`](src/renderer/src/ui/modals/dialogHelpers.ts)
(`showAlert`, `showConfirm`) and [`useConfirm`](src/renderer/src/hooks/useConfirm.ts).

### Accessibility

Treat accessibility as a first-class requirement for renderer UI work — not an
optional follow-up. When adding or changing UI, keyboard and screen-reader
support should be designed in from the start. See [FIXES.md](./FIXES.md) for a
detailed audit of known gaps and proposed fixes.

**Interactive elements**

- Use native `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` where
  possible. Do not attach `onClick` to `<div>`/`<span>` without `role`,
  `tabIndex`, and keyboard handlers — prefer a real `<button type="button">`.
- Icon-only buttons must have an `aria-label`. Do not rely on `title` as the
  sole accessible name. Keep inner icons decorative (`FaIcon` defaults to
  `aria-hidden`).
- Controls hidden until hover must still appear on keyboard focus — use
  `focus-visible:opacity-100` / `group-focus-within:opacity-100`, not hover
  alone (see `iconButton` in [`classes.ts`](src/renderer/src/ui/shared/classes.ts)).
- Set `type="button"` on buttons that are not form submit actions.

**Forms and labels**

- Every control needs a programmatic label: `<label htmlFor>` + matching `id`,
  wrapping `<label>`, or `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby`. Placeholder text is
  not a label.
- When a label targets a child component (`VariableInput`, `CodeEditor`), that
  component must accept and forward `id` and/or `aria-*` props to the underlying
  control.
- Validation errors need more than color: set `aria-invalid` and link the error
  text with `aria-describedby`.

**Dialogs and dynamic content**

- Build blocking dialogs on [`Modal`](src/renderer/src/components/Modal/index.tsx) with
  `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, an accessible name (`aria-labelledby` or
  `aria-label`), focus trap, initial focus, and focus restoration on close. Do
  not hand-roll one-off overlays.
- Announce important status changes (loading, sending, errors) with
  `role="status"` or `aria-live="polite"`. Follow the pattern in
  [`BusyIndicator`](../harborclient-sdk/src/components/BusyIndicator/index.tsx) (`@harborclient/sdk/components`).
- Expose selection and expansion state with `aria-current`, `aria-selected`, and
  `aria-expanded` — not color or background alone.

**Custom widgets**

- Tab bars and segmented controls must follow a WAI-ARIA pattern (`tablist` /
  `tab` / `tabpanel`, or `radiogroup` / `radio` for single-choice pickers). See
  [`SegmentedTabs`](src/renderer/src/components/SegmentedTabs/index.tsx).
- Drag-and-drop must have a keyboard-operable alternative (e.g. dnd-kit
  `KeyboardSensor` or explicit move actions in a menu).
- Resize handles and other custom controls need keyboard support and a visible
  focus indicator.

**Visual design**

- Do not convey information by color alone (status dots, pass/fail, errors).
  Pair color with text or an accessible name; mark decorative indicators
  `aria-hidden`.
- Check contrast for `text-muted` and small labels against WCAG 4.5:1 where
  they carry meaning.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations and spinners.
- **Minimum font size:** Never use font sizes below **14px** in renderer UI.
  Avoid `text-[11px]`, `text-[12px]`, `text-[13px]`, `text-xs`, and `prose-sm`
  (Typography’s `sm` preset can render nested elements smaller than 14px). Use
  `text-[14px]` as the minimum for labels, body text, badges, and metadata.
  Headings may be larger.

When fixing existing UI, prefer improving shared primitives (`Modal`,
`SegmentedTabs`, `VariableInput`, shared button classes) so one change lifts
many call sites.

## Documentation

Always add clear, useful documentation when you write or change code. Match the
JSDoc style already used in the codebase (see `src/renderer/src/ui/Request/Editor/`
and [`VariableInput`](../harborclient-sdk/src/components/VariableInput/index.tsx) (`@harborclient/sdk/components`) for examples).

**Every function** — exported or local, component or helper — must have a JSDoc
docblock. Explain what the function does and why, not just restate its name.
Document parameters with `@param`, return values with `@returns` when non-void,
and thrown errors with `@throws` when relevant.

**Every `useEffect` and `useMemo`** must have a docblock directly above the hook
call. For `useEffect`, describe the side effect, what triggers it, and any
cleanup. For `useMemo`, describe what is being derived and why memoization
matters.

**Props and types** — document non-obvious fields on interfaces and type aliases
with inline JSDoc comments. Name component props interfaces `Props` (not
`ComponentNameProps`).

**Docblock format** — never use single-line docblocks (`/** ... */`). Always
use multi-line blocks:

```ts
/**
 * Description here.
 */
```

When you touch existing code, add or improve docblocks for any functions or
hooks you modify. Prefer concise prose over repeating identifiers; a reader
should understand intent without opening the implementation.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is kept up to date automatically by the `post-commit` hook in
`.githooks/post-commit` (activated by `pnpm install` via the `prepare` script,
which sets `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`).

How it works:

- After each commit, the hook prepends `- <commit subject>. (\`<short sha>\`)`to
the`## Unreleased` section and amends the change into the same commit.
- The hook stays out of the way when:
  - `CHANGELOG.md` is already part of the commit (you wrote your own entry).
  - The commit is a merge, revert, fixup, squash, or `chore(changelog)` /
    `chore(release)` commit.
  - The commit subject is a bare version number like `0.4.9` or `v1.2.3`.
  - A rebase, cherry-pick, revert, or merge is in progress.
  - The commit's short SHA is already present in `## Unreleased`.

What this means for you:

- Write a clear, single-line commit subject — it becomes the changelog entry.
- If you want a more detailed entry than the subject line, edit `## Unreleased`
  yourself and stage `CHANGELOG.md` as part of the commit. The hook will detect
  it and leave your entry alone.
- Don't add version numbers or dates manually. The release workflow
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) bumps `package.json` and renames
  `## Unreleased` to `## <new version> - <YYYY-MM-DD>` when a maintainer
  triggers a release.
- Don't run version-bump commands locally (`pnpm version`, `npm version`,
  etc.); use the release workflow instead so the changelog and tags stay in sync.

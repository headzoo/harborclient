## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Use `pnpm dev -- -v` for verbose startup and diagnostic logging, or `pnpm dev -- -vv` to also log each outbound HTTP request (method, URL, request headers, and body). Response headers and response bodies are not logged.

## About HarborClient

**HarborClient** is a free, open-source desktop API client for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It gives you a familiar Postman-style workspace—collections, environments, request scripts, and a tabbed editor—while keeping your work on your machine or on storage you control. There are no accounts, subscriptions, or required cloud sync.

### Who is it for?

- **Individual developers** testing REST and HTTP APIs locally
- **Teams** that want shared collections without per-seat fees or vendor cloud sync—via a shared storage location, [Team Hub](https://github.com/headzoo/harborclient-service-hub), or git-backed collections
- **Privacy-minded users** who want data on their machine or infrastructure they operate (SQLite by default; optional MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Firestore)
- **Postman users** looking to migrate—HarborClient imports Postman v2.1 collection exports (see [collections docs](https://harborclient.com/collections#postman-collections))

### Why HarborClient instead of alternatives?

Most API clients tie your collections to a vendor account and a hosted sync service. HarborClient takes a different approach: your requests and environments live where you choose, and the app stays free to use.

- **No lock-in** — pluggable storage backends; export collections as portable JSON
- **You own your data** — local SQLite by default, or connect to a database you run
- **Free forever** — no accounts, subscriptions, or usage limits
- **Real desktop app** — a native Electron app, not a browser tab or hosted SaaS
- **Collaboration on your terms** — share via a common database, git repositories, or a self-hosted Team Hub
- **Familiar workflow** — collections, environments, pre/post scripts, and Postman import for a smooth switch

HarborClient does not claim full Postman feature parity; some Postman settings and scripts may need adjustment after import.

### Try it now

1. **Download** the latest release for your OS from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/harborclient/harborclient/releases/latest)
2. **Install and launch** — no Node.js or build tools required
3. **Send a first request** — paste a URL, pick a method, and click Send
4. **Optional:** import an existing Postman collection via **Collections → Import**

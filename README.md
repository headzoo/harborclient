**A desktop HTTP client to build, send, and inspect HTTP requests with collections, tabs, and local persistence.**

HarborClient is a Postman-style HTTP client built with Electron:

- **Request builder** — Method selector, URL bar, query params, headers, and body (none, JSON, or plain text)
- **Collections** — Organize saved requests into named collections with create, rename, and delete
- **Tabs** — Open multiple requests at once; tab state persists across restarts
- **Local storage** — Collections and requests saved in SQLite in app user data

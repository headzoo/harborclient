# Team hubs

Team hubs connect HarborClient to a running **[HarborClient Team Hub](https://github.com/headzoo/harborclient-service-hub)** instance — a self-hosted central server that stores shared collections for your team. Each hub is a named connection with a base URL and bearer API token. Collections you store on a hub live on the team hub; HarborClient syncs them into the sidebar and routes create, read, update, and delete operations through its HTTP API.

**Environments are not shared via team hubs.** Environment variable groups stay in your local registry on each machine, even though HarborClient Team Hub supports environments on the server. Use [Environments](/environments) for per-machine variable groups; use team hubs when you want teammates to share the same collection data.

## Prerequisites

Before adding a team hub in HarborClient, you need:

| Requirement               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HarborClient Team Hub** | A running team hub instance your team can reach over the network. See the [HarborClient Team Hub repository](https://github.com/headzoo/harborclient-service-hub) and [full documentation](https://headzoo.github.io/harborclient-service-hub/) for setup and deployment. |
| **Team hub URL**          | The team hub base URL (for example `http://127.0.0.1:8788` or `https://api.example.com`). HarborClient strips trailing slashes when saving.                                                                                                                               |
| **API token**             | A bearer token prefixed with `hbk_` that authorizes your HarborClient instance against protected API routes. Obtain or create tokens according to your team hub's documentation.                                                                                          |

HarborClient verifies connectivity when a hub is saved or mounted at launch. If the team hub is unreachable or the token is invalid, the hub is skipped and a warning is logged — other providers continue to work.

## Managing team hubs

Open **File → Team Hubs** to manage hub connections. The page lists every configured hub with its display name and URL.

### Add a team hub

| Step | Action                                                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Click **Add team hub**                                            |
| 2    | Enter a **Name** (shown in provider dropdowns and sidebar badges) |
| 3    | Enter the **Team hub URL**                                        |
| 4    | Enter the **API token**                                           |
| 5    | Click **Save**                                                    |

On success, HarborClient shows **Team hub saved.**, mounts the hub, and runs an additive sync so collections already on the team hub appear in the sidebar.

### Edit a team hub

Click **Edit** on a hub row, change any field, and click **Save**. HarborClient remounts the hub with the updated URL or token and syncs collections again.

### Delete a team hub

Click **Delete** on a hub row and confirm. Deleting a hub:

- Removes the hub connection from HarborClient
- Removes sidebar registry entries for collections that belonged to that hub
- Deletes the local id-map file HarborClient used to translate server UUIDs to numeric ids

Deleting a hub does **not** delete collections on HarborClient Team Hub itself — teammates who still have access can continue to use server-side data. Your local sidebar entries for that hub are removed.

## Collections on a team hub

HarborClient treats database connections and team hubs as **providers** — places where collection data can live.

### Choosing a provider

When you create or move a collection, pick the provider that should store its data:

| Location                        | How                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Create new collection**       | Sidebar **+** or **File → New Collection** → **Add collection** → **Create new** → choose **Provider** |
| **Move an existing collection** | **Collection Settings → General → Provider** → **Save**                                                |

The provider dropdown lists SQLite, Firestore, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and any configured team hubs. Team hubs are labeled **(Team Hub)**.

The **active database** (set in [Settings → Databases](/settings#databases)) is the default provider for new collections when you do not choose another one.

### Auto-sync

HarborClient syncs collections from each reachable hub:

- **On app launch** — after hubs are mounted, new team hub collections are added to the sidebar
- **When you save a hub** — immediately after add or edit

Sync is **additive**: collections on the team hub that are not yet in your sidebar are registered automatically. HarborClient does **not** remove sidebar entries when a collection is temporarily missing (for example, while the team hub is offline). You may see a warning instead.

There is **no background polling** or live sync. Changes made by teammates appear when HarborClient reloads data — for example, after restarting the app or when a hub is saved again.

### Sidebar badges

When a collection's provider is not your active database, its row shows a connection badge with the provider name (database or team hub). This helps distinguish local collections from hub-backed or shared remote-database collections.

## Moving and deleting collections

### Move a collection off a hub

In **Collection Settings → General**, change **Provider** to a database (or another hub) and click **Save**. HarborClient copies the collection's folders and requests to the target provider and updates the sidebar entry.

When the source is a team hub, HarborClient **leaves the original collection on HarborClient Team Hub**. Teammates keep access to the server copy. HarborClient records the collection as **detached** from that hub so a later sync does not re-add it to your sidebar.

When the source is a local or remote **database**, HarborClient deletes the source copy after a successful move, as before.

### Move a collection onto a hub

Choose a team hub as the target **Provider** and save. HarborClient creates the collection on the team hub via the API and removes the source copy from the previous database provider (standard move behavior).

### Delete a hub-backed collection

Choose **Delete** from the collection row menu. When the collection is stored on a team hub, HarborClient asks you to confirm that **team members will lose access** to the collection on the team hub. Confirming deletes the collection on HarborClient Team Hub and removes it from your sidebar.

Deleting a collection from a SQLite or remote-database provider does not show this team-access warning — only hub-backed collections affect shared server data.

## Team hubs vs other sharing options

HarborClient offers several ways to work with others. Pick the approach that matches how your team operates:

| Approach                                   | Best for                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQLite / local DB**                      | Solo work, offline-first, full control on one machine                                                                                                            |
| **Remote DB** (Firestore, MySQL, Postgres) | Team shares one database directly; configure connections in [Settings → Databases](/settings#databases)                                                          |
| **Encrypted invites**                      | One-step handoff of database credentials plus a collection; requires [Certificates](/certificates) and [Collections → Sharing](/collections#sharing-collections) |
| **Team hubs**                              | Team shares collections through HarborClient Team Hub with token-based access — no manual database setup per teammate                                            |

**Remote database vs team hub:** With a remote database, every teammate configures the same DB connection (or accepts an invite that embeds credentials). With a team hub, teammates only need the team hub URL and their own API token; collection data is exposed through HarborClient Team Hub's HTTP API.

**Invites vs team hubs:** Invites bundle remote **database** connection details and a single collection mapping. Team hubs are a separate path: collections live on HarborClient Team Hub, and sync discovers collections your token can access. The **Invite** row menu action is intended for remote-database sharing; for hub-backed collections, sharing is handled by granting team hub access (tokens) rather than sending an invite token.

## Team Hub LLM access

When your HarborClient Team Hub administrator enables LLM support, HarborClient can run AI chat through the hub instead of your personal provider keys. The hub holds the OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini keys in `server.yaml`; your desktop client only sends chat steps to the hub API.

| Topic              | Behavior                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Model picker**   | Hub models are labeled **Team Hub** and preferred over personal keys for the same model id |
| **Tool calling**   | HarborClient still executes tools locally against your open requests and collections       |
| **Access control** | Administrators grant LLM access and monthly token limits per user through the team hub CLI |
| **Fallback**       | Personal API keys in **Settings → AI** are used only for models your hubs do not offer     |

See the [AI assistant](/ai) guide and the team hub [LLM proxy documentation](https://headzoo.github.io/harborclient-service-hub/llm.html).

## Limitations

| Topic                      | Behavior                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live sync**              | No background polling. Reload data by restarting the app or saving a hub again.                                |
| **Environments**           | Not shared via hubs. Each HarborClient instance keeps its own environment list locally.                        |
| **Concurrent edits**       | Last write wins through the team hub API. HarborClient does not merge conflicting edits.                       |
| **Offline team hub**       | Hub-backed collections may show warnings if the team hub is unreachable; sidebar entries are not auto-deleted. |
| **Configuration location** | Team hubs are managed under **File → Team Hubs**, not under [Settings → Databases](/settings#databases).       |

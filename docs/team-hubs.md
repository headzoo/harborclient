# Team hubs

Team hubs connect HarborClient to a running **[HarborClient Team Hub](https://github.com/headzoo/harborclient-service-hub)** instance — a self-hosted central server that stores shared collections for your team. Each hub is a named connection with a base URL and bearer API token. Collections you store on a hub live on the team hub; HarborClient syncs them into the sidebar and routes create, read, update, and delete operations through its HTTP API.

**Environments are not shared via team hubs.** Environment variable groups stay in your local registry on each machine, even though HarborClient Team Hub supports environments on the server. Use [Environments](/environments) for per-machine variable groups; use team hubs when you want teammates to share the same collection data.

## Prerequisites

Before adding a team hub in HarborClient, you need:

| Requirement               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HarborClient Team Hub** | A running team hub instance your team can reach over the network. See the [HarborClient Team Hub repository](https://github.com/headzoo/harborclient-service-hub) and [full documentation](https://headzoo.github.io/harborclient-service-hub/) for setup and deployment. |
| **Team hub URL**          | The team hub base URL (for example `http://127.0.0.1:8788` or `https://api.example.com`). HarborClient strips trailing slashes when saving.                                                                                                                               |
| **API token**             | A bearer token prefixed with `hbk_` that authorizes your HarborClient instance against protected API routes. Obtain or create tokens according to your team hub's documentation.                                                                                          |

Each token belongs to a Team Hub account with a **role** that determines what HarborClient can do with that connection:

| Token role         | HarborClient behavior                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **user** (default) | Syncs collections; no **Manage team** access                             |
| **admin**          | Enables **Manage team**; does **not** sync collections (management-only) |

HarborClient verifies connectivity when a hub is saved or mounted at launch. If the team hub is unreachable or the token is invalid, the hub is skipped and a warning is logged — other providers continue to work.

## Managing team hubs

Open **File → Team Hub** to manage hub connections. The page lists every configured hub with its display name and URL.

### Add a team hub

| Step | Action                                                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Click **Add team hub**                                            |
| 2    | Enter a **Name** (shown in provider dropdowns and sidebar badges) |
| 3    | Enter the **Team hub URL**                                        |
| 4    | Enter the **API token**                                           |
| 5    | Click **Save**                                                    |

On success, HarborClient shows **Team hub saved.**, mounts the hub, and runs an additive sync so collections already on the team hub appear in the sidebar.

### Edit a team hub

Click **Edit** on a hub row, change any field, and click **Save**. HarborClient remounts the hub with the updated URL or token and syncs collections again.

### Delete a team hub

Click **Delete** on a hub row and confirm. Deleting a hub:

- Removes the hub connection from HarborClient
- Removes sidebar registry entries for collections that belonged to that hub
- Deletes the local id-map file HarborClient used to translate server UUIDs to numeric ids

Deleting a hub does **not** delete collections on HarborClient Team Hub itself — teammates who still have access can continue to use server-side data. Your local sidebar entries for that hub are removed.

## Admin tokens

An **admin token** is an `hbk_` bearer token issued for a Team Hub account with `role: admin`. It authorizes the management API — user accounts, roles, and access settings — not collection data.

Admin tokens are created on the Team Hub server, not in HarborClient. After your team hub is running and migrated, an operator can create an admin account and token from the server CLI:

```bash
team-hub user create --name ops --role admin
team-hub user token create --user <user-id> --name "Ops laptop"
```

See the Team Hub [authentication documentation](https://headzoo.github.io/harborclient-service-hub/auth.html) for the full CLI workflow, including additional tokens and revocation.

### Add an admin token in HarborClient

Admin tokens use the same **API token** field as regular hub connections — there is no separate admin setting.

| Step | Action                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Open **File → Team Hub**                                                         |
| 2    | Click **Add team hub** (or **Edit** an existing hub)                             |
| 3    | Enter a **Name**, **Team hub URL**, and paste the admin token into **API token** |
| 4    | Click **Save**                                                                   |

After save, HarborClient probes each hub with `GET /auth/session`. When the token reports `managementApi` capability:

- The hub row shows a green check icon with tooltip **Admin token**
- **Manage team** appears in the page header (when at least one admin hub is configured)

### Admin tokens and collections

Admin tokens cannot read or write collection data through HarborClient. The team hub API returns an empty collection list for admin tokens by design so the connection can still mount without errors.

**Recommended pattern:** configure one hub connection with a **user** token for daily work (collections and requests) and a separate connection with an **admin** token for team administration. You can also keep an admin connection and use it only when managing users.

## Managing team users

When at least one configured hub has an admin token, **File → Team Hub** shows a **Manage team** button. Use it to list, edit, and delete user accounts on the selected Team Hub server.

| Step | Action                                                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Open **File → Team Hub**                                                           |
| 2    | Click **Manage team**                                                              |
| 3    | If multiple admin hubs exist, choose the target hub from the **Team hub** dropdown |
| 4    | Review the user list (name, role badge, account id)                                |

Click **Back** to return to the hub connection list.

### Edit a user

Click **Edit** on a user row to open the edit dialog. Available fields:

| Field                       | Notes                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                    | Display name on the server                                             |
| **Role**                    | `user` or `admin`                                                      |
| **Collection access**       | `*` or comma-separated collection UUIDs (hidden when role is `admin`)  |
| **Environment access**      | `*` or comma-separated environment UUIDs (hidden when role is `admin`) |
| **LLM access**              | Checkbox — enable hub-provided AI models for this account              |
| **LLM models**              | `*` or comma-separated model ids                                       |
| **LLM monthly token limit** | Blank = unlimited                                                      |

Click **Save** to apply changes. HarborClient shows **User updated.** on success.

When you change a user's role to **admin**, collection and environment access fields are cleared on the server — admin accounts manage the hub but do not access entity data through the data API.

### Delete a user

Click **Delete** on a user row. Type `DELETE` in the confirmation field and click **Delete** again. This permanently removes the account and revokes all of its API tokens. HarborClient shows **User deleted.** on success.

### Create users

HarborClient does not create user accounts. Operators create them on the Team Hub server:

```bash
team-hub user create --name alice --role user
team-hub user token create --user <user-id> --name "Alice laptop"
```

Teammates then add their **user** token in HarborClient as described in [Add a team hub](#add-a-team-hub).

## Collections on a team hub

HarborClient treats database connections and team hubs as **providers** — places where collection data can live.

### Choosing a provider

When you create or move a collection, pick the provider that should store its data:

| Location                        | How                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Create new collection**       | Sidebar **+** or **File → New Collection** → **Add collection** → **Create new** → choose **Provider** |
| **Move an existing collection** | **Collection Settings → General → Provider** → **Save**                                                |

The provider dropdown lists SQLite, Firestore, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and any configured team hubs. Team hubs are labeled **(Team Hub)**.

The **active database** (set in [Settings → Databases](/settings#databases)) is the default provider for new collections when you do not choose another one.

### Auto-sync

HarborClient syncs collections from each reachable hub:

- **On app launch** — after hubs are mounted, new team hub collections are added to the sidebar
- **When you save a hub** — immediately after add or edit

Sync is **additive**: collections on the team hub that are not yet in your sidebar are registered automatically. When the hub is **reachable**, collections deleted on the server are removed from your sidebar on the next sync (app launch, hub save, or manual provider sync). When the hub is **offline or unreachable**, existing sidebar entries are kept until the hub can be contacted again.

There is **no background polling** or live sync. Changes made by teammates appear when HarborClient reloads data — for example, after restarting the app or when a hub is saved again.

### Sidebar badges

When a collection's provider is not your active database, its row shows a connection badge with the provider name (database or team hub). This helps distinguish local collections from hub-backed or shared remote-database collections.

## Moving and deleting collections

### Move a collection off a hub

In **Collection Settings → General**, change **Provider** to a database (or another hub) and click **Save**. HarborClient copies the collection's folders and requests to the target provider and updates the sidebar entry.

When the source is a team hub, HarborClient **leaves the original collection on HarborClient Team Hub**. Teammates keep access to the server copy. HarborClient records the collection as **detached** from that hub so a later sync does not re-add it to your sidebar.

When the source is a local or remote **database**, HarborClient deletes the source copy after a successful move, as before.

### Move a collection onto a hub

Choose a team hub as the target **Provider** and save. HarborClient creates the collection on the team hub via the API and removes the source copy from the previous database provider (standard move behavior).

### Delete a hub-backed collection

Choose **Delete** from the collection row menu. When the collection is stored on a team hub, HarborClient asks you to confirm that **team members will lose access** to the collection on the team hub. Confirming deletes the collection on HarborClient Team Hub and removes it from your sidebar.

Deleting a collection from a SQLite or remote-database provider does not show this team-access warning — only hub-backed collections affect shared server data.

## Team hubs vs other sharing options

HarborClient offers several ways to work with others. Pick the approach that matches how your team operates:

| Approach                                   | Best for                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQLite / local DB**                      | Solo work, offline-first, full control on one machine                                                                                                            |
| **Remote DB** (Firestore, MySQL, Postgres) | Team shares one database directly; configure connections in [Settings → Databases](/settings#databases)                                                          |
| **Encrypted invites**                      | One-step handoff of database credentials plus a collection; requires [Certificates](/certificates) and [Collections → Sharing](/collections#sharing-collections) |
| **Team hubs**                              | Team shares collections through HarborClient Team Hub with token-based access — no manual database setup per teammate                                            |

**Remote database vs team hub:** With a remote database, every teammate configures the same DB connection (or accepts an invite that embeds credentials). With a team hub, teammates only need the team hub URL and their own API token; collection data is exposed through HarborClient Team Hub's HTTP API.

**Invites vs team hubs:** Invites bundle remote **database** connection details and a single collection mapping. Team hubs are a separate path: collections live on HarborClient Team Hub, and sync discovers collections your token can access. The **Invite** row menu action is intended for remote-database sharing; for hub-backed collections, sharing is handled by granting team hub access (tokens) rather than sending an invite token.

## Team Hub LLM access

When your HarborClient Team Hub administrator enables LLM support, HarborClient can run AI chat through the hub instead of your personal provider keys. The hub holds the OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini keys in `server.yaml`; your desktop client only sends chat steps to the hub API.

| Topic              | Behavior                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model picker**   | Hub models are labeled **Team Hub** and preferred over personal keys for the same model id                                    |
| **Tool calling**   | HarborClient still executes tools locally against your open requests and collections                                          |
| **Access control** | Administrators grant LLM access and monthly token limits per user through **Manage team** in HarborClient or the team hub CLI |
| **Fallback**       | Personal API keys in **Settings → AI** are used only for models your hubs do not offer                                        |

See the [AI assistant](/ai) guide and the team hub [LLM proxy documentation](https://headzoo.github.io/harborclient-service-hub/llm.html).

## Limitations

| Topic                      | Behavior                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live sync**              | No background polling. Reload data by restarting the app or saving a hub again.                                |
| **Environments**           | Not shared via hubs. Each HarborClient instance keeps its own environment list locally.                        |
| **Concurrent edits**       | Last write wins through the team hub API. HarborClient does not merge conflicting edits.                       |
| **Offline team hub**       | Hub-backed collections may show warnings if the team hub is unreachable; sidebar entries are not auto-deleted. |
| **Configuration location** | Team hubs are managed under **File → Team Hub**, not under [Settings → Databases](/settings#databases).        |

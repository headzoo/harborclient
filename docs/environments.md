# Environments

Environments are app-wide groups of variables. Unlike collection variables, which belong to a single collection, environments are global: you create them once and can activate any environment from the TabBar while working across collections and tabs.

One active environment is shared across all open request tabs. When an environment is selected, its variables become available to every request you send.

## Managing environments

The **Environments** section in the sidebar sits below **Collections**. Each section can be collapsed independently.

- **Add** — Click the `+` button in the Environments header to create a new environment. Enter a name in the dialog.
- **Activate** — Click an environment name to make it the active environment. The selected row is highlighted.
- **Settings** — Double-click an environment, or choose **Settings** from the row menu, to open environment settings. Edit the name and variables, then save.
- **Delete** — Choose **Delete** from the row menu. This removes the environment and clears the active selection if it was selected.

## Selecting an environment

Use the environment dropdown on the far right of the TabBar. Choose an environment name to activate it, or **No Environment** to clear the selection.

The active environment persists across app restarts. All tabs share the same selection.

## Variables

Environment variables use the same shape as collection variables and support `{{key}}` syntax in:

- Request URLs
- Headers and query params
- Request body
- Pre- and post-request script source

Each variable has four fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | Variable name referenced in `{{key}}` placeholders |
| **Value** | Value substituted when the variable is resolved |
| **Default** | Used when Value is empty |
| **Share** | Same field as collection variables; environment export is not supported yet |

When Value is empty, HarborClient uses Default instead.

## Precedence

At send time, HarborClient builds a runtime variable map from the active collection and the active environment. Collection variables are loaded first; environment variables are applied on top. When both define the same key, the **environment wins**.

Values set with `hc.variables.set` in a pre- or post-request script override both collection and environment variables for the remainder of that send. See [Request scripts](/request-scripts) for script execution order and the `hc.variables` API.

  ScriptSet["hc.variables.set"] --> Substitute

The request editor highlights `{{variable}}` tokens using the merged set of collection and environment variables, with environment values shown when keys overlap.

## Storage

Environment records are stored alongside collections and requests:

- **SQLite** — `environments` table in `{userData}/harborclient.db`
- **Firestore** — `environments` collection when using the Firestore database provider
- **MySQL** — `environments` table when using the MySQL database provider

See [Settings](/settings) for database provider and connection configuration.

The active environment ID is stored in browser `localStorage` under `harborclient.activeEnvironmentId`, not in the database.
